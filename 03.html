FOR IT!</h2>

some myths about
falling</h2>
                    <h3 class="blue">Only really frail or infirm
people fall, don’t they?<br></h3>
                    <p>Not at all. One in three people
over 65 – plenty of them in
decent health – will have a fall
this year. However it’s true that
our risk of falling increases as
we age: half of all people over
80 will fall at least once a year.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <h3 class="blue">It’s just an inevitable part of
getting older, isn’t it?<br></h3>
                    <p>Not necessarily. Experts believe
the vast majority of falls could
be prevented with some fairly
modest changes to our lifestyle
and homes. Medically speaking,
though, falls are often a warning
sign that something isn’t quite
right – but it’s often something
quite treatable.<br></p>

overleaf: you might be
surprised by how many
boxes you tick.<br></p>
                    <p>Then take a few minutes to read
this booklet. With falls robbing
many older people of their hardwon
health and independence,
– and costing us all £2.3 billion
a year – it could be the most
valuable time you spend today<br></p>

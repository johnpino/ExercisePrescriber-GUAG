                    <h3 class="white">Balance&nbsp;</h3>
                    <p>We rely on our balance to stay
upright when we over-reach for
something or trip up. But as we
age, our balance reaction times
get slower and so do reflexes.
That makes it harder to regain
balance, especially when doing
something quickly.<br></p>
                    <p class=""><b class="">What can I do <img src="img/question-mark.png"></b></p>
                    <p class=""><img align="right" src="img/07b.png" width="80px" />It’s surprisingly easy to
improve your balance:
see centre pages
(16-17) for some simple
regular exercises
(no Lycra required!)<br></p>
                    <h3 class="white">Muscle strength
and joints&nbsp;</h3>
                    <p>Between the ages of 50 and
70, we lose about 30% of our
muscle strength, which isn’t
great news if we’re trying to
regain our balance or stop a fall.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class=""><b>What can I do <img src="img/question-mark.png"></b></p>
                    <p>Regular physical activity
strengthens muscles, whatever
your age. The recommended
activity level is 30 minutes,
five times a week: gardening,
vigorous housework, cycling and
daily walks all count. Experts
also advise twice-weekly&nbsp;muscle-strengthening exercises
for the over-65s.<br></p>

                    <h3 class="white">Bones</h3>
                    <p>Bones naturally become more
brittle as we age, which makes
a fracture more likely if we do
fall. This is true for both men and
women, but is especially true in
post-menopausal women.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><b>What can I do <img src="img/question-mark.png"></b></p>
                    <p>Weight-bearing activities are
also great for maintaining strong
bones, and a healthy balanced
diet will help ensure you get
enough calcium to maintain
bone strength.</p>
                    <p>Vitamin D, which helps the body
absorb calcium, can be obtained
from exposure to sunlight and
from some foods.</p>
                    <p>Certain groups of the population
are at risk of not getting enough
vitamin D. The Government
recommends people 65 years
and over, those not exposed to
much sun, and those with darker
skin, all take a daily vitamin D
supplement (10 micrograms).</p>
                    <p>Sunlight exposure without
sunscreen should be limited to
10 mins per day on the arms
and face between May and
September but NO burning!<br></p>

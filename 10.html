or garden. Not surprising, as homes
get old too: carpets get worn, clutter
builds up and we may not stay on top
of maintenance as we once did</h2>

                    <p>Often we don’t notice problems
because we’ve lived with them
so long. But clutter can present
a very real risk for falls. So take
a few minutes to look round your
home with a critical eye, using
the checklist below.</p>
                    <h3 class="cyan">Lighting</h3>
                    <p>Did you know that 60-year-old
eyes need three times more
light than 20-year-old eyes?
Consult a trusted, professional
electrician about your lighting
options – such as branched
lights to replace single bulbs –
to increase light without glare.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>• Avoid trailing cables from
lamps that could trip you.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>• Consider installing two-way
switches on the landing/hall
and/or extra stair lighting.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                    <p>Wire&nbsp;in a smoke alarm at the same
time – one more hazard sorted!<br></p>
                    <p>• Always use your bedside light
when getting up at night; if the
switch is not easily accessible
keep a good torch by the bed.</p>
                    <p>• Never walk about in the dark: if
you regularly get up for the loo,
keep a landing light on.<br></p>
                    <h3 class="cyan">Living areas</h3>
                    <p>• Check all rugs have a non-slip
underlay and replace worn
ones. Consider replacing
frayed carpets, or ask
someone to tack them down.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>• Cable tidies and/or boxes will
organise jumbled wires by the
TV, computer or music centre.
Tape any trailing extension
leads to skirting boards.<br></p>

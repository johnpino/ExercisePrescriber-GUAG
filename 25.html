introducing the topic. Start with
“You seem a bit unsteady, which
must be annoying. I hear you can
do something about that...”</p>

to check their medications.</p>
                        <p>• Are they shuffling when they
walk? They may need to
do flexibility and strength
exercises so they can lift
their feet higher.</p>
                        <p>• Are they walking very
slowly? Perhaps a fear of
falling is slowing them down,
or do you find that the
person is getting forgetful or
muddled (which is linked to
a higher falls risk)? </p>

GP about dealing with any
medical problems. In some cases
they could be referred to a local
falls clinic. A physiotherapist can
give advice about strengthening
and balance exercises.<br></p>

                    <p>Give them a copy of this booklet
and encourage them to carry
out the actions recommended
in it. Ask if they would like you
to look round their home to see
if you can spot and remove any
obstacles or fall risks. See pages <a href="#04">here </a>and <a href="#13">here </a>for advice on
fall-proofing their environment.</p>
                    <p>The exercises on <a href="#07">"6 exercises for
strength and
balance"</a> are especially useful. If
they seem unmotivated and/
or depressed, could you do the
exercises with them? Is there
a local older people’s exercise
group they could join? Research
shows group exercise has huge
physical and social benefits.<br></p>

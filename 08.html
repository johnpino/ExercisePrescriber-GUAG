                    <p>If you hurry, especially in the
dark at night, it can make falls
more likely. And 3-6 million
people over 60 in the UK have
urinary incontinence problems.<br></p>
                    <p><b>What can I do <img src="img/question-mark.png"></b></p>
                    <p>Incontinence can be improved
and sometimes cured – talk
to your continence nurse
or physiotherapist. You can
also refer yourself to a local
continence clinic, which can
recommend exercises and
give advice. Some continence
medications can also make you
dizzy – let them know.<a href="http://csp.org.uk/conditions/incontinence" target="_blank"><br><br>csp.org.uk/conditions/incontinence</a><br></p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Multiple medications</h3>
                    <p>The older we get, the more
likely we are to be prescribed
medications for several different
health conditions; it’s estimated
that 36% of people over 75 are
on four or more different drugs.
Some common ones are
associated with dizziness,
drops in blood pressure when
you stand up, or sleepiness –
all of which can raise the risk
of falling. </p>

                    <p>Talk to your GP if you are
experiencing any of these
problems and ask whether your
medication should be adjusted.</p>

                    <p class="cursive-text text-center">“It was only when a new young
GP started at the surgery
that I had all my medication
reviewed , and she reduced
some of my doses. I feel much
better and no longer feel
so dizzy when I stand up.”<br></p>

                    <p><b>What can I do <img src="img/question-mark.png"></b></p>
                    <p>Never stop taking any prescribed
medication suddenly. If you
suspect one or more of your
medications is making you dizzy
or faint, see your GP – and
make sure the GP reviews your
prescriptions every 12 months.
(That’s every six months if you
are over 75 or taking four or
more medications.) Watch out for
alcohol intake: you may find you
can’t drink the same quantity
you used to without feeling dizzy
or ill, and it may interact with
prescribed medications.<br></p>

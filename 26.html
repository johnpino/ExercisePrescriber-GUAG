                    <p><img align="left" src="img/26a.png" width="50" style="vertical-align: top; margin-right: 10px;">Don’t try to get them up
straight away – unless it was
a quick slip or trip and you
know they’re fine. They will
need a few minutes, just
to get over the immediate
shock and for the body to
signal any injuries.<br></p> 
                    <p><img align="left" src="img/26b.png" width="50" style="vertical-align: top; margin-right: 10px;">Make sure the person is as
comfortable as possible –
putting a pillow (or rolled up
coat if outside) under their
head and finding something
warm to keep them
covered. Get them to take
slow, calm breaths<br></p> 
                    <p><img align="left" src="img/26c.png" width="50" style="vertical-align: top; margin-right: 10px;">Call for help, by dialling 999
if necessary.<br></p>

                    <p><img align="left" src="img/26d.png" width="50" style="vertical-align: top; margin-right: 10px;">If you think they are
uninjured and can get up,
see how much of it they can
do themselves using the
technique on <a href="#">here</a>. This
is both safer for you, and
also good practice for them
in case they fall again
when alone.<br></p>

                    <p><img align="left" src="img/26e.png" width="50" style="vertical-align: top; margin-right: 10px;">Your ability to help will
depend on your physique
and health and on their
strength and balance. The
safest way is the technique
described on <a href="#09">here</a>: be
there to guide them, or
assist only enough that risks
no injury to either of you.<br></p> 
                    <p><img align="left" src="img/26f.png" width="50" style="vertical-align: top; margin-right: 10px;">Try not to lift them, but if
you have to and there is no
other help around – and if
you are fit enough – you are
best off standing behind
them, bending your knees,
with your arms around
their middle (not under
their arms). Count to three
together, then both stand up
at the same time.<br></p> 
                    <p><img align="left" src="img/26g.png" width="50" style="vertical-align: top; margin-right: 10px;">When they’re seated and
you can both rest, scan
them again for injuries.
Tell their GP about the fall
so they can give advice
and assistance on cutting
future risks.<br></p>

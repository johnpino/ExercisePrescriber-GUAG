years ago reveals how our bodies have
changed on the outside – admittedly,
not always a joyful lesson! But what
about the changes on the inside?
We can’t see them, but they can put us
at greater risk of falling</h2>

                    <p>We can’t stop the ageing
process, but we can counteract
some of the effects with a few
gentle tweaks to our lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Previous falls (with or without
injury) are one of the biggest
independent risk factors
for falling again; guidelines
recommend that if you have or
have had a fall you should get
yourself reviewed if this has not
been done automatically.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Mention it to your GP or
physiotherapist at your next
routine appointment. If you are
not seeing someone regularly,
make a specific appointment to
see someone to discuss it.<br></p>

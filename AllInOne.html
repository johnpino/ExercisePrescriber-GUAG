some myths about
falling</h2> 
                    <h3 class="blue">Only really frail or infirm
people fall, don’t they?<br></h3> 
                    <p>Not at all. One in three people
over 65 – plenty of them in
decent health – will have a fall
this year. However it’s true that
our risk of falling increases as
we age: half of all people over
80 will fall at least once a year.&nbsp;<br></p> 
                    <h3 class="blue">It’s just an inevitable part of
getting older, isn’t it?<br></h3> 
                    <p>Not necessarily. Experts believe
the vast majority of falls could
be prevented with some fairly
modest changes to our lifestyle
and homes. Medically speaking,
though, falls are often a warning
sign that something isn’t quite
right – but it’s often something
quite treatable.<br></p>

many older people of their hardwon
health and independence,
– and costing us all £2.3 billion
a year – it could be the most

                    <h3 class="white">Balance&nbsp;</h3>
                    <p>We rely on our balance to stay
upright when we over-reach for
something or trip up. But as we
age, our balance reaction times
get slower and so do reflexes.
That makes it harder to regain
balance, especially when doing
something quickly.<br></p>
                    <p class=""><b class="">What can I do <img src="img/question-mark.png"></b></p>
                    <p class=""><img align="right" src="img/07b.png" width="80px" />It’s surprisingly easy to
improve your balance:
see centre pages
(16-17) for some simple
regular exercises
(no Lycra required!)<br></p>
                    <h3 class="white">Muscle strength
and joints&nbsp;</h3>
                    <p>Between the ages of 50 and
70, we lose about 30% of our
muscle strength, which isn’t
great news if we’re trying to
regain our balance or stop a fall.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class=""><b>What can I do <img src="img/question-mark.png"></b></p>
                    <p>Regular physical activity
strengthens muscles, whatever
your age. The recommended
activity level is 30 minutes,
five times a week: gardening,
vigorous housework, cycling and
daily walks all count. Experts
also advise twice-weekly&nbsp;muscle-strengthening exercises
for the over-65s.<br></p>

                    <h3 class="white">Bones</h3>
                    <p>Bones naturally become more
brittle as we age, which makes
a fracture more likely if we do
fall. This is true for both men and
women, but is especially true in
post-menopausal women.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><b>What can I do <img src="img/question-mark.png"></b></p>
                    <p>Weight-bearing activities are
also great for maintaining strong
bones, and a healthy balanced
diet will help ensure you get
enough calcium to maintain
bone strength.</p>
                    <p>Vitamin D, which helps the body
absorb calcium, can be obtained
from exposure to sunlight and
from some foods.</p>
                    <p>Certain groups of the population
are at risk of not getting enough
vitamin D. The Government
recommends people 65 years
and over, those not exposed to
much sun, and those with darker
skin, all take a daily vitamin D
supplement (10 micrograms).</p>
                    <p>Sunlight exposure without
sunscreen should be limited to
10 mins per day on the arms
and face between May and
September but NO burning!<br></p>

                    <p>If you hurry, especially in the
dark at night, it can make falls
more likely. And 3-6 million
people over 60 in the UK have
urinary incontinence problems.<br></p>

                    <p>Incontinence can be improved
and sometimes cured – talk
to your continence nurse
or physiotherapist. You can
also refer yourself to a local
continence clinic, which can
recommend exercises and
give advice. Some continence
medications can also make you
dizzy – let them know.<a href="http://csp.org.uk/conditions/incontinence" target="_blank"><br><br>csp.org.uk/conditions/incontinence</a><br></p> 
                    <h3 class="orange">Multiple medications</h3> 
                    <p>The older we get, the more
likely we are to be prescribed
medications for several different
health conditions; it’s estimated
that 36% of people over 75 are
on four or more different drugs.
Some common ones are
associated with dizziness,
drops in blood pressure when
you stand up, or sleepiness –
all of which can raise the risk
of falling. </p>

                    <p>Never stop taking any prescribed
medication suddenly. If you
suspect one or more of your
medications is making you dizzy
or faint, see your GP – and
make sure the GP reviews your
prescriptions every 12 months.
(That’s every six months if you
are over 75 or taking four or
more medications.) Watch out for
alcohol intake: you may find you
can’t drink the same quantity
you used to without feeling dizzy
or ill, and it may interact with
prescribed medications.<br></p>

                    <p>It’s not just ‘old-age long
sight’ that can cause vision
problems. Ageing can decrease
contrast sensitivity (making
it harder to see the edge of

                    <p>As we get older, drinking the

blood alcohol concentration.
This is because fat replaces
muscle as we age, and alcohol
is not drawn into body fat as
well as it is into muscle.&nbsp;</p>

home with a critical eye, using
the checklist below.</p> 
                    <h3 class="cyan">Lighting</h3> 
                    <p>Did you know that 60-year-old
eyes need three times more
light than 20-year-old eyes?
Consult a trusted, professional
electrician about your lighting
options – such as branched
lights to replace single bulbs –
to increase light without glare.&nbsp;</p> 
                    <p>• Avoid trailing cables from
lamps that could trip you.&nbsp;</p> 
                    <p>• Consider installing two-way
switches on the landing/hall
and/or extra stair lighting.</p> 
                </div>                 
                <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"> 
                    <p>Wire&nbsp;in a smoke alarm at the same
time – one more hazard sorted!<br></p> 
                    <p>• Always use your bedside light
when getting up at night; if the
switch is not easily accessible
keep a good torch by the bed.</p> 
                    <p>• Never walk about in the dark: if
you regularly get up for the loo,
keep a landing light on.<br></p> 
                    <h3 class="cyan">Living areas</h3> 
                    <p>• Check all rugs have a non-slip
underlay and replace worn
ones. Consider replacing
frayed carpets, or ask
someone to tack them down.&nbsp;</p> 
                    <p>• Cable tidies and/or boxes will
organise jumbled wires by the
TV, computer or music centre.
Tape any trailing extension
leads to skirting boards.<br></p>

                    <p>Don’t be embarrassed to use a
walking aid if it helps you stay
steady. It’s important a stick is
the right length: level with your
wrist crease when your arm is
down by your side. It should also
have a rubber end (‘ferrule’) to
stop it slipping; replace worn-out
ones promptly. If a stick is no
longer quite enough, talk to your
physiotherapist about getting
a walking frame or rollator
(wheeled frame).<br></p>

about falls that they restrict
their movement and spend
long periods sitting down.
This harms balance, body
strength and mobility,

It’s a vicious circle that
damages confidence and
independence.</p>

small, gradual goals taking
the steps in this booklet.
Enlist friends/relatives
to help, stay positive,
and practise relaxation
exercises for anxious
moments.</p>

                    <h3>How to choose shoes</h3>
                    <p>Soles should be thin enough
for you to feel and ‘read’ the
ground under your feet, but
have enough cushioning for
shock-absorption, as well as
tread for gripping.</p>
                    <p>Heels should be low and broad
for maximum stability.
Choose a round or square-toed
style to give your toes more
space – and enough depth so
you can wriggle them inside.</p>
                    <p>Shoes should be long enough
so your toes don’t touch
the end and should provide
support around the middle part
of your foot.</p>
                    <p>Go for styles with fastenings
such as laces to give support.
Avoid ballet pumps and
flip-flops!<br></p>

best off standing behind
them, bending your knees,
with your arms around
their middle (not under
